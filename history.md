# Warehouse history 

This section is dedicated to recording all changes and updates to our data warehouse. The current version (v1.0) was released in September 2023, and as we’re just starting, there are no previous versions yet. Moving forward, a detailed log of all modifications will be maintained here. Each new version will be assigned a unique number, and we’ll detail what’s changed, what’s new, and what’s been fixed or removed.
